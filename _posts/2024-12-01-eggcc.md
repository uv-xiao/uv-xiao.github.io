# Eggcc

> I'm trying to use e-graph/eqsat/extract/... to do some compiler-involved stuff. The [eggcc](https://github.com/egraphs-good/eggcc) is a good starting point. And here is my note of it.
{: .block-tip}

## About

[eggcc](https://github.com/egraphs-good/eggcc) compiles [bril](https://github.com/uwplse/bril) to LLVMIR/cranelift. It is mainly hosted by UW PLSE lab (I guess, since the active contributors, including Oliver Flatt, Anjali Pal, and Yihong Zhang, are from the lab). The project is still under heavy development, and lacks open documentation. I found it very inspiring as a rewrite-based, more specifically [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog)-based compiler. So here is my note of it.

Related work:

- [jlm](https://github.com/phate/jlm): `RVSDG`-based compiler: `llvmir -> RVSDG -> llvmir/mlir/circt`;
- [optir](https://github.com/jameysharp/optir/):  proof-of-concept `RVSDG`-based compiler, use [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg) for optimization;


## Have the first try

Follow [eggcc's README](https://github.com/egraphs-good/eggcc)'s instruction for installation (which should be fine :smiley:), then run:

```
cargo run -- --debug-dir ./temp --run-mode optimize  <bril, e.g. ./tests/passing/small/loop_if.bril> 
```

Then, [eggcc](https://github.com/egraphs-good/eggcc) will generate the `temp` directory, holding some visualization files for `rvsdg`, `cfg`, and `dag`. And the optimized `bril` code will be printed to stdout.

Also, you can run (after some npm setup):

```
bash infra/localnightly.sh <bril file or directory>
cd nightly/output && python3 -m http.server
```

to get a local server for report and visualization of `eggcc`'s runs.
