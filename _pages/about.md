I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of IC, Peking University, advised by Prof. [Yun Liang](https://ericlyun.me). My research focuses on software techniques for architecture-hardware co-specialization, with emphasis on domain-specific languages (DSLs), compiler techniques, and hardware synthesis frameworks. Before that, I received my Bachelor of Science in EECS at Peking University in 2022.

My research work centers on developing EDA software techniques that bridge the gap between high-level architectural specifications and low-level hardware implementations. I have contributed to several projects focusing on multi-level intermediate representations, hardware synthesis frameworks, and domain-specific processor customization. Notable contributions include the development of the open-source hardware description language Cement (FPGA 2024) and the high-level synthesis framework Hector (ICCAD 2022), as well as work on automatic accelerator generation with control flow and data access optimization (Cayman, DAC 2025). Currently, I am working on frameworks for automatic processor instruction customization using equivalence anti-unification techniques and full-stack solutions for domain-specific processor design.

I'm thinking about exploring composite compilation techniques that integrate formal methods with large language models for architecture-hardware co-optimization. I'm also interested in software techniques for architecture exploration with comprehensive modeling of data movement patterns and microarchitecture design spaces in mind, and get both hardware and evaluation in ONE CLICK. Additionally, I'm thinking about automatic generation for specialized programming models (DSLs) that can adapt to different hardware architectures. My ultimate dream is to establish comprehensive frameworks that enable unified abstraction-based architecture performance analysis, automatic optimization, and seamless hardware implementation generation.
